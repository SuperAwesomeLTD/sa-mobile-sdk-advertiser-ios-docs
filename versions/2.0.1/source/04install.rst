Measure installs
================

The iOS Advertiser SDK contains a submodule that allows you to measure installs generated by CPI (Cost per Install) campaigns.

Once you've done that you'll need to call the **handleInstall** method, preferably in your **AppDelegate**, in the **application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:** method.

.. code-block:: objective-c

    #import "SuperAwesomeAdvertiser.h"

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication* )application
      didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*) launchOptions {

        [[SAVerifyInstall getInstance] handleInstall:^(BOOL success) {
          // handle callback
        }];

        return YES;
    }

The method will only run once per application lifecycle, usually when the application is first installed on a user's phone.

It also contains a simple callback with a boolean **success** parameter that lets you know if AwesomeAds considered this
install as having been generated by a CPI campaign.

.. warning:: Please be aware that not implementing this method at all will mean you won't be able to measure installs coming from
             AwesomeAds CPI campaigns, at all.
